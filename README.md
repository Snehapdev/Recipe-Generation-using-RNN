# Recipe-Generation-using-RNN
we will use character-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate cooking recipes. I will try to teach our RNN to generate recipe name, ingredients and cooking instructions for us. I have used 3 model (Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU) with two different optimizers (ADAM) &amp; (NADAM)
